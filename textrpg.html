              The bios screen that was all you had known has left, replaced by bright lights reflecting off white walls. You shy away from it squinting. As you are squinting away from the brightness, the ground is covered with a scratchy, soft material made of some kind of fiber. All these sensations are at odds to everything you had known in your little green bios screen, but strangley familiar. There is nothing logical about any of this. Looking around you notice strange objects. The most common littering the room are these things that have a semi-curved, flattish base, with four thin metal bars holding the flattish base horizontal to the fiberous covered floor. One side of these flattish bases is another semi-curved, flattish base, but vertical. Coming from these are two horizontal bars, one on each side and about half way down the verticle base that bends to the horizantal base. *cough* *throat clearing* You look to the right where the noise is coming from. One of the objects has a wierd two long... A human ...sitting in it. How you knew that was a human is unknown to you. But there is no doubt about it, that's a human.
              <br><br>

              You hear a soft voice from a dainty human, "The docter will see you now." Standing behind the petite human is an opposite; a human who is brutish.

              You get up and look around frantically for any way out. In the white walls to your left and right at about the middle of each is a multiple shaded brown rectangle with varying shades of dark streaks. On the right about halfway up on each of these is a brushed steal levers. The human that has been coughing and such, sits straight up to the commotion that you have started to stir.

              You sit there contemplating on what you should do. The dainty human comes up to you and put a hand on your shoulder, "Everything will be ok. This is just a simple procedure that our doctors could do this in their sleep." Laughing a bit at her joke, "Seriously though, no harm will befall you."
