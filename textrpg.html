              he bios screen that was all you had known has left, replaced by bright white lights reflecting off white walls. You shy away from it squinting. As you look down from the brightness, the ground is covered with a gray scratchy, soft material made of some kind of fiber. All these sensations are at odds to everything you had known in your little green bios screen, but somehow strangely familiar. There is nothing logical about any of this. Looking around you notice strange objects. The most common littering the room are these things that have a semi-curved, flattish base, with four thin metal bars holding the flattish base horizontal to the fibrous covered floor. One side of these flattish bases is another semi-curved, flattish base, but vertical. Coming from these are two horizontal bars, one on each side and about half way down the vertical base that bends to the horizontal base. *cough* *throat clearing* You look to the right where the noise is coming from. One of the objects has weird two tapered... wait, it comes to you, a human. How you knew that was a human is unknown to you. But there is no doubt about it, that's a human. What a human is still escapes you though.
              <br><br>

              *click* You hear a soft voice from a dainty human, "The doctor will see you now." Standing behind the petite human is an opposite; a human who is brutish.

              You get up and look around frantically for any way out. In the white walls to your left and right at about the middle of each is a multiple shaded brown vertical rectangle with varying shades of dark streaks. On the right about halfway up on each of these is a brushed steal lever. The human that has been coughing and such, sits up to the commotion that you are starting to stir.

              You sit there contemplating on what you should do. The dainty human comes up to you and put a hand on your shoulder, "Everything will be ok. This is just a simple procedure that our doctors could do in their sleep." Laughing a bit at her absurd joke, "Seriously though, no harm will befall you."

              As you try to get away from all of this, you encounter the the brutish looking human. He overbears you and puts you into a bear hug. The petite individual walks up to you, leans into your ear and whispers, "We can do this the easy way or the hard way. It is up to you."

              You struggle to try to break free. It is fruitless though as the brute has a superior hold onto you. You hear, "Get this person to the operating room at once," says the petite voiced human.

              You decide to follow the petite human. The petite human walks over to the left brownish vertical rectangle, inserts a small flat object into a box next to it, and opens the door. After going through, you hear the heavy steps of the brute behind you. Glancing back you see the brute has a sly smile on his face and the eyes are looking right at you. You back around when you hear a click and turn to see the dainty human holding open one side of the double steel doors, motioning you to go in.

              You hear the faint sound of water droplets falling on the concrete. As you look around, squinting, you find something that catches your eye across the room.  You step forward and a large steel door crashes behind you.  Looking around, you become aware that what had caught your eye are in fact large surgical jars full of all sorts of foreign specimens.  Due to your curiosity, you move closer and come to realize that the room is full of operating equipment.  As your eyes begin to adjust to the dim light, you see a large operating table in front of you. <br>

              As you begin to explore around the room you hear loud footsteps quickly approaching... What will you do?

    <div class="row">

      <div class="ending-scene" style="font-size:30px;">As you are standing quietly in the cabinet, you accidentally bump into something.  A chill travels down your spine as you hear the sound of glass shattering.  You quickly realize that you may be in trouble.  Moments later, the cabinet doors fly open and a large hand grasps you and throws you to the ground.  You struggle, but it is hopeless.  You feel a sharp pain in the side of your neck and you realize that you have been injected with some sort of syringe... you feel your body rapidly getting weaker... it is becoming very difficult to keep your eyes open.<br><br>

        As you lie there helplessly on the floor, your vision blurs and the world as you've known fades away...
